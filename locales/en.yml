        description: Pair programming is the manifestation of our philosophy that coding is not an isolated endeavor. Working in pairs strengthens the skills of everyone on our team and boosts the overall quality of our work. All day every day, two people are working together to solve exactly one problem at a time. Through partnership and careful prioritization, our products are useful on day one and continue to get better over time.

          title: Who are you?
          subtitle: We're a diverse team of engineers and designers committed to democratic principles.
          paragraphs:
            - When everyone has a voice, we are better equipped to build software that faces business challenges head on.
            - We see every interaction as a chance to advocate for and uphold the egalitarian principles that make just and accessible societies.
        why:
          title: What do you do?
          subtitle: When it comes to code, we believe thinking is more important than typing.
          paragraphs:
            - We use pair programming and narrative techniques to reach true understanding—not only between people on our team and yours, but ultimately between you and your customers.
            - By working in dialogue, we create a better, more equitable process for writing sustainable software.
        you:
          title: Who do you work with?
          subtitle: We work in tandem with teams who are looking for more than just engineering.
          paragraphs:
            - They want to get to the heart of the matter through the process of building software.
            - Our collaboration is rooted in the exchange of information to uncover the true story of their business.
        what:
          title: What problems do you solve?
          subtitle: On the surface we make businesses run more efficiently.
          paragraphs:
            - But we're really solving a much larger problem. By bringing more voices to every problem we solve, we incorporate a diversity of perspectives into every product we build.
            - Transparency goes beyond honesty. It's a way for us to see and understand the goals of your business. And for you to see and understand what we're building and how we're building it.
        how:
          title: How are you different?
          subtitle: We work slowly and methodically to help you get where you're going faster. This isn't a paradox.
          paragraphs:
            - Breaking down the whole into discrete steps allows us to understand the purpose of every task and its part in a larger process—because this is what affects real people.
            - By prioritizing every action during every stage of development, the products we create together are useful from day one and continue to get better over time.

        title: Goals
        description: Starting at the end helps us know how to begin. Before we write a single line of code, we have to articulate what we're trying to accomplish. We use targeted and measurable goals to inform how we approach the work ahead of us. Together we look at what you want to build and, more importantly, how it will impact your business.
      inception:
        title: Inception
        description: "At the heart of this conversation is a simple question: How can we be successful? We mark the beginning of every project with an informational session to define goals, ask the hard questions, put our goals under the proverbial microscope, and prioritize the immediate tasks at hand. You can think of it as a day-long transfer of knowledge so that we can get to work the very next day."

      description: Every voice that joins our team strengthens it. Our belief in inclusivity is not just good for productivity – it creates a culture that values people on a much larger scale. We only program in pairs because two minds can solve problems better than one. Which means everyone gets to learn from diverse perspectives.
