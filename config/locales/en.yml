  dog_story:
    - |
      One time, and this would be in the early 90s, I was staying
      with Jud and Suzanne during an eviction.  These were people
      we'd known for a decade, and they were so close to the family
      that I'd even been the ring bearer at their wedding.
      Even more importantly, they liked watching Star Trek and even
      wore stupid matching uniforms for costume parties.

      Jud and Suzanne owned two big grumpy dogs.  We're talking like
      30 pounds or so of dog here, not one of those skinny active labs
      like the kids have nowadays.  Moreover, if you've ever owned
      grumpy dogs, you know that the worst thing mistake is to run and
      jump and yell and make loud noise in general.  Predictably, the
      dogs didn't think much of me.

      One night, and this is the night of the title of this story, the
      power went out as a result of two closely related incidents.
      First, Hurricane Andrew was in the process of destroying the
      Eastern seaboard. Hurricane Andrew was the first time I had ever
      been picked up and flung down the driveway by wind.

      Second, and most importantly I suppose, the house itself was right
      next to a transformer station.  I don't know much about power
      load distribution, but based on my D in high school physics, I
      suppose I know enough about how to light things on fire with
      electricity.  This is what happened to the transformer station.

      To return to the dogs, they had figured the whole thing out from
      the start.  I was the loudest thing around, and therefore anything
      louder and less expected, such as lightning, gale force wind or a
      transformer exploding, must be my fault.
    - |
      The moment these dogs decided to do something about all this noise
      and get me to stop it was also the moment I'd chosen to use the
      bathroom.  After opening the door, which was a bit of an ordeal
      since I managed to lock the doorknob twice in the process, I was
      confronted with both angry dogs.
    - |
      As with most of my initial reactions to stressful situations, this
      one involved me yelling for help.  "Help!" only made the dogs more
      upset, because they were expecting quiet, not even more loud kid
      noise.  The only response was to start barking, which made me yell
      more because people in general don't like growling barking dogs.
      Finally, the two of them dragged me out of the room by biting onto
      my right arm and leg. I think I passed out.
