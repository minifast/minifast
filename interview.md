# Ministry of Velocity Interview Playbook

For developers who will be working directly on our customer's team, we expect that our customer will perform the requisite interviewing that makes them feel comfortable.

All developer interviews follow the same schedule.  Developers will pair with Ministry of Velocity staff on stories in a Pivotal Tracker backlog.  Developers are measured based on the most important metric we have: do we want to pair with this person again tomorrow?


## Interview Truth Table

* Yes + Yes: Positive
* Yes + Maybe: Positive
* Maybe + Maybe: Discuss and report on abilities, possibly invite back to pair with another MoV staff member
* No + Maybe: Negative
* No + No: Negative
* No + Yes: Negative

Developers will pair program with one Ministry of Velocity consultant before lunch, switch to another consultant after lunch, and leave early so that an internal retrospective can be run.
