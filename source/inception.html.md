# Ministry of Velocity Inception Playbook

An inception is a strategic meeting, facilitated by a Ministry of Velocity consultant, that marks the beginning of every project at Ministry of Velocity. At the core is a sipmle question: how can we be successful?

The main success factor for a session is full participation by an engaged audience, meaning laptop and cell phone use is heavily discouraged.  In addition to lunch, there are breaks throughout the day.

1. 10am – Introductions and High-level Product Concept Review
2. 10:30am – Goals and Timeline
3. 11am – Break
4. 11:15am – Risks
5. 11:45pm – User Roles
6. 12pm – Activities and Workflows
7. 12:30pm – Lunch
8. 1:30pm – Story Mapping
9. 2:15pm – Break
10. 2:30pm – Story Mapping (continued)
11. 3pm – Estimation
12. 3:30pm –  Risks Evaluation and Prioritization
13. 4pm – End of Day

## Introductions

Everyone in the room is a participant in the project, from the developers, to the designers, to the product owner. Everyone should be on the same page when the day starts.  Here’s what the facilitator will do:

* Start with a round-robin Name / Role / Company soundoff
* Discuss the agenda items, pointing out breaks.
* Remind participants to stow electronic devices in order to keep everyone engaged
* Create a space for terms (acronyms/vocabulary that some participants might not have heard)
* Ask if everyone is clear on the agenda and rules

## High-Level Product Concept Review

All the project participants should have a clear idea of how the end product looks and behaves. The facilitator hands control over to the product owner, who will:

* Introduce the design of the project, both in terms of broad-level UX concepts and UI

## Goals

Goals of the engagement should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound (SMART). The facilitator will:

* Solicit goals from the group
* Record all goals on a whiteboard, then group into categories, such as:
  * **Business goals.** For example: better user growth profile, more engineering efficiency, public launch of a product, or better conversion metrics.
  * **Product goals.** For example: better SLA, production readiness, or fewer errors.
  * **Engagement goals.** For example: training on a new language, learning how to do inceptions, or onboarding to a pair programming team.
  * **Anti-goals.** For example: open source, lens flares, or technical bells & whistles.

## Risks

It’s important to record all risks to the project’s success. This is best done as a writing activity. The facilitator guides each participant through the following steps:

* Get a pile of 3x5 index cards
* Consider the risks associated with each goal, and writes each risk on an index card, including:
  * **Business risks.** For example, “does the market want this?” or “will an emerging technology disrupt this product?”
  * **Technical risks.** For example, “are there 3rd party integrations?” or “are there unknown technologies/libraries to learn?” or “does the product rely on platforms that are changing, like iOS or Android?”
  * **Schedule risks.** For example, “are there pre-MVP phases to satisfy third parties, such as developers on another team?” or “is there a near term, immovable milestone like a festival launch?”
* Collect cards and identify common themes as a group, which are then written on a whiteboard
* Each participant spends 3 points to vote on the most important themes

## Roles and Workflows

No system exists as an island, and roles are played by many different kinds of actors. The facilitator will:

* Ask participants for the roles, both internal and external
  * Examples include: internal developers, internal non-developer team members, customers, apps, third-party entities.
  * Or, on a typical Wordpress site, roles will be: visitors (guests), members, and editorial administrators.
* Write each role on a 3x5 index card
* Capture the activities in the workflows of each role
  * For example, in a credit rating app, a consumer will sign up, connect their credit cards, confirm their identity via address, and view their credit score. A sales representative will identify consumers with low credit ratings, send them suggestions on improving their credit, and sell them another credit card.

## Story Mapping

The next step is to record each activity in a workflow as a unit of work with clear requirements. The facilitator will:

* Lead the conversation on what stories make up each activity.
  * Reminder: only one conversation happens at a time.
  * Reminder: stay impartial and only ask clarifying questions.
* Break down each activity as small as possible, but no smaller. Ideal stories will have very clear requirements.
* If it looks like there will be too many stories to get through:
  * Prioritize activities as High/Medium/Low
  * Create stories for all the Highs first, Mediums next, Low if there’s time
  * Get breadth across the app, so that after the inception, there’s at least enough detail for the app to be useful, if not complete

## Estimation

Estimates are unique for each product team, and reflect relative complexity. The facilitator will:

* Make swimlanes on the table in a Fibonacci progression (1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
* Encourage developers to discuss each story, then
* Shift each discussed story into the appropriate swimlane
* Write the final point total onto each card

## Prioritization

Once the stories are estimated, the process of forming them into a backlog begins.  The facilitator hands off the process to the product owner, who will:

  * Consult the project’s goals and risks
  * High-risk/high-priority/high-point stories should get done sooner than later
  * Consider mitigating risks by addressing unknowns sooner in the project
  * Attempt to identify mini-releases within the backlog
