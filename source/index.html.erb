    <h1>What does Ministry of Velocity do?</h1>
    <p>
      We focus on improving communication. Developers on modern teams spend well over half their waking hours designing or implementing software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We emphasize discipline. The most senior teams we've seen are exemplars of consistency, especially in the face of changing business needs.

    <h1>Why communication over technology?</h1>
    <p>
      Software structure reflects its producing team's communication structure. We believe that improving both is possible, but improving communication has a lasting impact on velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software is critical to our modern world: it dispatches fire fighters, puts money into bank accounts and prints report cards. Enabling software to respond to real needs is our goal.

    <h1>What impact do you have on teams?</h1>
    <p>
      We partner with you. We apply standard practices acquired from academia, government and psychology to improve the quality and speed of analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We build great software by example. While all code can benefit from our time, your team already knows where we can do the most good.

    <h1>What are agile and extreme programming?</h1>
    <p>
      Agile is shorthand for discovering your users' needs, working as a team, delivering software and learning from experience. In practice, agile means valuing people over process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extreme programming is a state of iterative team improvement. We practice some of its components, like test-driven development, pair programmingÂ and continuous deployment.
