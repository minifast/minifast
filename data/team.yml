      Doc Ritezel has been compulsively pair programming for 5 years.
      People have started to whisper, his friends and loved ones have staged
      interventions, but pairing seems to be infectious, and he might be beyond
      help.

      Robert Head revels in spreading the joys of agile collaboration,
      remote pair programming, and humane, effective development processes.
      He's based in the little mountain town of Ashland, Oregon,
      midway between Seattle and San Francisco. When he's not coding,
      he creates ephemeral aesthetic artifacts such as music and choreography.

      I was born in the cornfields and grew up among the bears. I have come to
      be the truest expression of my upbringing. Come aboard my zodiac and we
      can sail the bay.
