      Damien has been working in web technologies for approximately two decades
      and is a veteran of over a half-dozen startups. He holds a degree in
      computer science from the MIT, but attributes his most important skills as
      an engineer to his experience and training as poker player, actor, and
      hypnotist. When he is not building software and software teams he keeps
      busy doing things he doesn't know how to do.
